What I Did
- Practiced Linux navigation using both relative and absolute paths.
- Used `ls -l` to list directory contents.
- Copied files and directories with `cp`.
- Observed terminal color codes for files and directories.

 Why I Did It
- To understand the basics of Linux command line operations.
- To practice directory navigation and file manipulation.
- To learn the difference between copying a folder vs. its contents.

 What I Learned
- `cd` can use both `..` (relative) and `/home/...` (absolute) paths.
- `ls -l` shows details like permissions, size, and modification date.
- `cp` can copy entire directories (`-r`) or just contents.
- Linux colors mean different file types (blue = directory, yellow = executable, green = normal file).
