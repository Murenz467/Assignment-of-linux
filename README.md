 Assignment1 

Name: Murenzi Charles  
Student ID: 27386  

What I Did
- Practiced Linux navigation using both relative and absolute paths.
- Used `ls -l` to list directory contents.
- Copied files and directories with `cp`.
- Observed terminal color codes for files and directories.

 Why I Did It
- To understand the basics of Linux command line operations.
- To practice directory navigation and file manipulation.
- To learn the difference between copying a folder vs. its contents.

 What I Learned
- `cd` can use both `..` (relative) and `/home/...` (absolute) paths.
- `ls -l` shows details like permissions, size, and modification date.
- `cp` can copy entire directories (`-r`) or just contents.
- Linux colors mean different file types (blue = directory, yellow = executable, green = normal file).

What I Did

Cloned the repository from GitHub.

Created a branch using the required format (27386_Murenzi_Charles_assignment1).

Answered the Linux conceptual questions by writing commands and explanations.

Captured screenshots showing commands and their outputs.

Pushed all work to my personal branch instead of the main branch.

Why I Did It

To build confidence in Linux navigation, file manipulation, and path management.

To understand the difference between relative and absolute paths in practical tasks.

To improve my skills in Git branching and version control workflow.

What I Learned

How relative and absolute paths differ and when each is useful.

Practical usage of common Linux commands like ls, cd, cp, along with their variations.

Why branching is necessary for organized and safe Git workflow.

How terminal color codes help identify file types such as directories, executables, and regular files.
